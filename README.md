# Move 2.0
A QBasic program I wrote when I was really young.

## Background

When I was very young, I had acess to a Tandy T1000.  This machine had DOS
installed on it and it came prepacked with a bunch of games and also QBasic
which at the time was an mainstream programming language.

My cousin, Daniel Phillips, showed me some basic commands in DOS and also
the basics of how to write a program in QBasic.  I fell in love and played
around with it for the entire summer instead of playing outside.

Years later, my father bought a Mac and I eventually persuaded him to let
me install an early hypervisor on it that let me run Windows in a VM hosted
by our family's mac.  This became my new playground (the Tandy had certainly
worn out by then :) ) So, one summer, I composed a program that takes a set
of commands and lets you move a cursor around the screen.

One day, after spending most of the summer afternoon working on this QBasic
program, I showed it to my father.  He asked me if I would print it out, so
I did.  He kept it in a drawer in his desk.  Within the past year, he has
returned this early relic of my past to me.

This repository houses the scanned in print out that my dad gave me (in PDF)
along with a first attempt at coding it up.

## Process

I decided to go line by line and type the whole thing back in.  I did not use
OCR, and I also did not make any corrections. It was only 12 pages of type
12 font, and has only taken me a few hours of typing to get the whole thing
inputted. It's in a file in this repository called [move20.qb].  I also want
to note that I did not change bugs that I found, nor did I change any grammar
mistakes in the prompts, so it definitely still seems like a program that
a young kid would write.

## Running

Information on how to run the program will go here.
